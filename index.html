<p>Hello World</p>

if we want the git to track our changes, then 
we first have to add the file
to stage the file -> git add filename

the index.html file has been added(staged) but we have to commit it 
we have not added the readme.md file 

to add(stage) all the files, we enter the command ->
git add .
the changes are ready to be committed

commit means the record has been added
(the record is of wedding not of engagement)
git commit -m 'some msg'
-m means what will be the msg. of that commit
keep the msg meaningful, if we added a new feature then add the msg. 
like 'added new btn'
or 'fix new bug'

The below line means that we are 1 commit ahead on our local system 
as compared to our
github, we can't see our index.html on our github for now 
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.

To make the changes available on our github we have to use 
push cmd means we push our 
changes from our local system to our github account

authorize vs code, so that we can able to make our changes through 
vs code

all the showing lines in the terminal means that our push is successful
after refreshing we can see our new changes, we can see the commit msg also
and all other changes that we have made in our files of local system    

we have done 6 commits till now
initial commit which will be presented everytime
the shown is the histroy that git tracks, we can even see it through 
git also 

git push origin main
git push is the basic cmd, means we have to push our code

by default all the repos of our git are called remote repos
and from that remote repos we extract a default repo through 
which we
have cloned our code
means our default repo, through which we are changing anything 
in our code or files then the changes should go to the remote repo

we have named origin to our remote github, we can change its name
the copy of the repo which is on our github, we have named it origin 

and in that origin we are pushing our code in the brand named 'main'
main is the name of the branch
