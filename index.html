<p>Hello World</p>

if we want the git to track our changes, then 
we first have to add the file
to stage the file -> git add filename

the index.html file has been added(staged) but we have to commit it 
we have not added the readme.md file 

to add(stage) all the files, we enter the command ->
git add .
