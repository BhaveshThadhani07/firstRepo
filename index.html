<p>Hello World</p>

if we want the git to track our changes, then 
we first have to add the file
to stage the file -> git add filename

the index.html file has been added(staged) but we have to commit it 
we have not added the readme.md file 

to add(stage) all the files, we enter the command ->
git add .
the changes are ready to be committed

commit means the record has been added
(the record is of wedding not of engagement)
git commit -m 'some msg'
-m means what will be the msg. of that commit
keep the msg meaningful, if we added a new feature then add the msg. like 'added new btn'
or 'fix new bug'
